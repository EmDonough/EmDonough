- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmDonough
- 👀 I’m interested in ... not being a complete fool!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to ... "program" ... and ... "computers" ... and their applications as a presage
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing! I'm a n00b, so best to not reach out,,, lest you want a lead weight lol
- 📫 How to reach me ... reticence, probably. I don't talk much, people are too draining.

      & thus concludes my banal intro
